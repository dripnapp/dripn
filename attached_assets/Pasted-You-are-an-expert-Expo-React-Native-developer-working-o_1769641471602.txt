You are an expert Expo / React Native developer working on an earn-to-crypto app called "Drip'n" using Expo SDK 54, Expo Router, Zustand, react-native-google-mobile-ads v16, and Unity Ads mediated through AdMob.

Current situation:
- The home screen (app/index.tsx) has two separate rewarded ad buttons: "Watch Video Ad" (AdMob) and "Unity Ads".
- Both use the exact same ad unit ID in production: ca-app-pub-4501953262639636/8435825886 (test ID in dev).
- This causes potential conflicts because two RewardedAd instances are created for the same unit.
- The goal is to simplify to ONE prominent "Watch Rewarded Video" button that maximizes fill rate and user momentum.
- Assume Unity Ads is (or will be) properly set up as a mediation network in the AdMob dashboard for the rewarded ad unit above (waterfall or bidding).
- If mediation is working, one ad unit + one RewardedAd instance should be enough — AdMob will automatically try Unity when direct fill is low.
- For extra reliability (in case mediation fill from Unity is inconsistent), allow an optional second explicit instance with a different unit ID (but prefer mediation-first approach).
- Keep the existing fallback: if no ad is ready/loaded, show the internal <VideoPlayer /> component after a short delay.
- Keep the daily cap check (5000 drips), web mock (+100 points), Expo Go warnings, and the first_video badge logic in handleVideoComplete.
- The EARNED_REWARD listener should award 100–200 drips randomly (keep for now), trigger badge if first time, and show success alert.

Task:
Refactor app/index.tsx to achieve this:
1. Remove the separate "Unity Ads" task card / button entirely.
2. Keep only one main rewarded video task card (rename label to something like "Watch Rewarded Video" or "Earn Drips Now" and update subtitle to "Earn 100–200 drips").
3. In useEffect setupAds:
   - Use ONE primary ad unit ID (the existing one).
   - Create ONE primary RewardedAd instance (AdMob + mediated Unity).
   - Load it once on init.
   - Optionally: if I tell you later I have a separate Unity unit ID, add a fallback instance — but default to mediated-only for now.
   - Add proper event listeners: EARNED_REWARD (award points + badge logic), ERROR (log), and ideally FULLSCREEN_CONTENT_DISMISSED or LOADED to reload the ad automatically after show/close.
4. Create a new unified handler (e.g. handleWatchRewarded) that:
   - Checks daily cap.
   - Handles web mock.
   - Tries to show the primary ad if loaded.
   - If not loaded, attempts to load it and show (with timeout fallback).
   - If still fails → shows the internal VideoPlayer as fallback.
   - (Optional: if fallbackAd exists, try that second before internal video.)
5. Update the onPress of the remaining video ad task card to call this new unified handler.
6. Merge / clean up any duplicate calls (e.g. the "AdMob Offers" card currently also calls handleWatchAd — decide if it should be different or removed/merged).
7. Keep all other parts of the file (balance card, redeem modal, share buttons, offerwall modals, onboarding flow, etc.) unchanged unless directly conflicting.
8. For the unique user ID: When username is first set (in UsernameSetup onSave), generate a simple unique ID if not already present (e.g. using Date.now() + random string or expo-crypto randomUUID if imported), store it in Zustand as userId: string | null with a setUserId action, but do NOT change the existing store file unless necessary — just implement the generation logic in the component.

Rules:
- Do NOT break existing flows (splash, onboarding, terms, username setup, redemption modal, dark mode, etc.).
- Use existing utilities: initializeAds, createRewardedAd, getAdEventTypes from src/utils/ads.ts.
- Keep __DEV__ test IDs.
- Add console logs where helpful for debugging ad load/show states.
- Make sure the ad reloads after being shown/dismissed to be ready for next time.
- Output ONLY the updated app/index.tsx file (full content) + any small required changes to other files (e.g. store if userId added, or components/UsernameSetup.tsx if needed).
- If you need to add imports (e.g. expo-crypto for better UUID), do so.
- Keep code clean, typed where possible, and follow existing style.
