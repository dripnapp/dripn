Build a React Native Expo mobile app called "Crypto Pulse Rewards - ADFI” (a crypto version of Swagbucks) with the following full features and requirements:

Core Concept:
- Users earn small amounts of points for completing micro-tasks (mainly watching rewarded video ads via AdMob, later add app download/install tasks).
- Points are tracked in stable USD value (e.g., 100 points = $1).
- Users can cash out points as XRP (Ripple cryptocurrency) to their connected wallet at current market price (via CoinGecko API).
- App takes the majority profit (70-90% margins) after covering ad revenue share, XRP fees, and user rewards (users get 10-20% of ad earnings per task).
- Highly autonomous: automated task verification, payouts, and anti-fraud measures.

Key Features & Requirements:
1. Wallet Connection:
   - "Connect XRP Wallet" button using xumm-sdk (Xaman) for Testnet initially (switchable to Mainnet later).
   - Show QR code and deeplink for signing in Xaman app.
   - Save connected r-address using AsyncStorage.
   - Only use Testnet for development/testing.

2. Payout & Volatility Handling:
   - Minimum cashout threshold: $5 USD equivalent in points (adjustable).
   - Before any task or cashout: one-time popup with checkboxes users must accept:
     - "I understand XRP price is volatile and payout value in XRP may change."
     - "I acknowledge payouts are in XRP at current market rate at time of cashout."
     - "I'm 18+ and understand risks of crypto."
   - At cashout, fetch current XRP price from CoinGecko API, show estimated XRP amount, and send equivalent XRP (using xumm-sdk payload for user-signed send tx).

3. UI/UX Design Principles:
   - Very crisp, clean, minimalist, mobile-first design.
   - Intuitive and easy enough for kids to navigate (big buttons, clear icons, simple flow).
   - But deep enough for adults: earnings history, detailed FAQ, tax info links.
   - Support light/dark mode.
   - Onboarding tutorial screens on first launch (explain how to earn, connect wallet, cash out).
   - Sections: Home (dashboard), Tasks, Wallet, Learn (crypto/XRP basics), Legal (disclaimers), Terms of Use.

4. Tasks & Incentives:
   - Main task: "Watch Video" rewarded ad button (placeholder for AdMob rewarded videos).
   - Tiered rewards: basic tasks (low points), premium tasks (higher points, e.g., longer videos or app installs).
   - Daily caps to prevent abuse (e.g., max $5/day earnings).
   - Referral program: Generate invite code, referrers get 10% of referees' earnings for 30 days (in points), app takes small cut.

5. Gamification & Retention:
   - Badges and levels (e.g., Bronze at 100 points, unlocks bonuses like extra daily tasks).
   - Streaks (daily login multipliers).
   - Progress bar for earnings toward next level/threshold.

6. Security & Safeguards:
   - Anti-fraud: CAPTCHA on tasks, device fingerprinting if possible, daily earning caps.
   - Never expose API keys/secrets client-side (prepare for future backend proxy).
   - Non-custodial: App never holds user funds/keys.
   - Clear legal disclaimers everywhere.

7. Technical Stack Preferences:
   - Use Expo + React Native.
   - State management: Zustand.
   - Storage: @react-native-async-storage/async-storage.
   - API calls: axios (for CoinGecko XRP price).
   - Icons: @expo/vector-icons.
   - Safe area handling: react-native-safe-area-context.

Make the app functional as an MVP with Testnet only, clean code, and error handling/alerts for everything (e.g., connection fails, low balance, etc.).
Start with Home screen dashboard showing balance, connected status, and task buttons.
